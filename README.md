# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for Advent of Code 2021. This year I am a bit boring, as I am learning Kotlin and practicing C++ with Abseil.

## Script for starting a new day

```bash
./new_day.sh <day_name>
```

## Kotlin

### Running code

```bash
kotlin kotlin/day<day_name>.py <filename>
```

where `<filename>` is usually `simple` or `full`.

### Testing code

...TODO? :)


## Other language candidates

- Dart to see what it's like and learn Flutter
- Go to see what not caring about code style feels like
